An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document or web page.
HTML is composed of a tree of HTML nodes, such as text nodes. 
Each node can have HTML attributes specified. 
Nodes can also have content, including other nodes and text. 
Many HTML nodes represent semantics, or meaning. 
For example, the <title> node represents the title of the document.
